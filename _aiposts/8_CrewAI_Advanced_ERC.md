### Notes
When I first tried using CrewAI, it was mind-blowing. This particular project demonstrates how AI agents carry out assigned tasks under the guidance of a supervisor.
By default, you can see the agents’ “thought process.” If one approach fails, the agent will troubleshoot and explore other options to complete the task—they don’t just throw errors.
I’ve included a step-by-step guide for anyone interested in exploring agentic systems, and I personally find them incredibly powerful. Satisfaction guaranteed.
Using the CrewAI framework, you define the agent and task using plain English. 
It’s just like writing a description of the crew you want to hire: 
> the personality
> 
> required skills
> 
> expected performance standards
> 
> SMART goals
> 
> the step-by-step work procedures you expect your crew to follow
> 
> etc

Simply amazing!
