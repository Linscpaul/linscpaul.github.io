## 💡 Foundations in Data & Optimization

> My academic background is rooted in deep quantitative excellence and pioneering engineering projects:

### A Passion for Quantitative Rigor

> ==Academic Excellence==: My commitment to technical mastery is reflected in achieving an 'A' grade for every technical course in my Engineering degree.
>
> <mark>Analytical Leadership</mark>: During my MBA, I was consistently ranked among the TOP 5% in all Digital-related courses, applying quantitative and qualitative analytics across Marketing, Finance, and HR functions.
>
> <mark>Enduring Quantitative Strength</mark>: My mathematics grades have been consistently high throughout my entire education, from primary school through to my degree, underscoring a lifelong aptitude for numerical reasoning.

### Pioneering Engineering & Research

> Brain-Controlled Robotics (NTU Innovation Project): I led a project to build an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) from scratch. Our ambitious focus was on brain-controlled navigation, requiring us to implement machine learning chips for brainwave detection and training. This project gave me early, hands-on experience with the powerful synergy between sensors, data acquisition, and machine learning.
>
> Optimization & Simulation (NTU Final Year Project): My final year research involved a complex optimization and simulation model designed to significantly reduce the carbon footprint in commercial buildings.
>
> Master’s Focus: I further specialized my expertise with a Master's degree focused on Operations Research, Applied Predictive Methods, Forecasting, and Optimization.

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
