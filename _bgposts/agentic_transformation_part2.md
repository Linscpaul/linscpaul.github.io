This article address several fundamental business questions essential for organisations transitioning to Agentic AI.

The article address several critical business questions regarding the implementation and governance of agentic AI systems. These questions address strategic, operational, and risk-related concerns:

## 1. How is "Agentic Maturity" actually defined?

Maturity is not measured by the sophistication of the AI tools used, but by the deliberate design of governance. 

The true maturity is found in how an organization engineers accountability, reversibility, and a controlled failure radius rather than just the level of autonomy achieved.

## 2. Where does our organization currently stand on the maturity curve?

The model provides a diagnostic framework to identify the current state, noting that 80% of companies reside at Level 0, where AI functions merely as advanced assistants with no action capability. To find the "ground truth," leaders are encouraged to ask:

* "Which of your AI systems can execute actions without human intervention?"

* "When they fail, who gets woken up at 3 AM?"

## 3. What are the specific risks and failure modes at different stages?

The sources detail the dangers inherent in scaling AI:

* Level 2 (The Danger Zone): Risks include "Silent Scope Creep" (adding tasks without adjusting governance), monitoring gaps where humans cannot keep pace with AI speed, and accountability erosion.

* Level 3 (The Complexity Cliff): Risks include cascading failures where errors propagate across agent clusters and "Accountability Diffusion," where no individual takes ownership of system failures.

## 4. How should we govern and control autonomous systems?

The necessary controls for safe operation:

* Implementing "Bright-line rules" to define what an agent is forbidden from doing.

* Creating Circuit Breakers to automatically isolate failing agent clusters.

* Establishing Board-Level Risk Committees focused specifically on AI-system exposure for high-level autonomous systems.

## 5. Where should we intentionally limit the use of AI agents?

A key strategic question addressed is "What will we forbid?". The business should establish corporate policy ceilings by domain:

* Finance & Legal: Should generally be capped at Level 2 with mandatory human reviews.

* Marketing: May reach Level 3 for tasks like A/B testing orchestration but requires spend caps.

*  Non-agentizable categories: Identifying which decision categories should explicitly never be handled by agents.

## 6. What are the practical next steps for executive leadership?
Moving from theory to execution by these steps:

* Map three critical business processes against the model to determine their current maturity.

* Set a maturity ceiling for each process to decide the maximum level of autonomy permitted.

* Define three governance controls that must be established before moving up a level.

## 7. How can leadership distinguish between hype and reality?

If any business leader claim to build an "agentic enterprise", ask the leader:

* "Which maturity level, in which domain, with what failure radius?"

* "Show me one decision that has moved from human-only to agent-assisted in the past quarter".
