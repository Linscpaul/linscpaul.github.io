This article address several fundamental business questions essential for organisations transitioning to Agentic AI. These questions cover the technological definition, organizational impact, governance, and leadership requirements.

## 1. What is the technical definition of Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is a **"probabilistic execution system"** rather than just a sophisticated chatbot. To qualify as an agent, a system must possess four non-negotiable properties:

* **Goal-Oriented & Planning-Capable:** It can create and dynamically revise plans to meet objectives.

* **Action-Capable:** It executes tasks via APIs or systems rather than just suggesting them.

* **Stateful & Self-Memory:** It maintains tactical context across multi-step journeys.

* **Closed-Loop Feedback:** It operates on a "Sense → Plan → Act → Evaluate" cycle.

## 2. How does Agentic AI differ from full autonomy?

A key distinction is that Agentic AI does not equal autonomy. 

Agents are **bounded**, **probabilistic executors** with **failure rates significantly higher than deterministic software**. Because their reasoning can be opaque and their costs non-linear, the sources state that strategies must be built around supervision rather than abdication.

## 3. How will this technology restructure the workforce and management?

The primary impact is the restructuring of work, not necessarily headcount reduction.

* **Role Transformation:** Static roles become "dynamic task graphs" where work is distributed between human and agent "nodes".

* **New Employee Functions:** Employees shift from being "doers" to being Task Designers, Reviewers/Validators, and Exception Handlers.

* **Management Impact:** Middle management undergoes "compression" as agents handle administrative coordination. This exposes the irreducible value of managers: resolving conflict, absorbing ambiguity, and holding accountability.

* **Systemic Complexity:** Managing a hybrid human-agent workforce actually increases systemic complexity due to new failure modes like inter-agent communication breakdowns.

## 4. How should governance be structured for a hybrid system?

Governance must evolve to manage the interactions between humans, agents, and legacy systems. There are three specific mechanisms:

* **Accountability Mapping:** Defining exactly which human is personally accountable for an agent’s actions and what the agent's authority limits are.

* **Decision Tiering:** Categorising decisions into Tier 1 (Fully Agentizable) for reversible/low-impact tasks, Tier 2 (Human-in-the-Loop) for high-value/recoverable tasks, and Tier 3 (Non-Agentizable) for irreversible, regulatory, or reputational actions.

* **Behavioral Guardrails:** Implementing hard-coded controls like API sandboxes, cost ceilings, and "kill switches" to halt and roll back actions.

## 5. How must leadership evolve to manage these systems?

Leadership must move away from an "efficiency obsession" toward "resilience engineering". Leaders must become:

* **Decision Architects:** Designing the rules of engagement and determining which decisions belong to which tier.

* **Failure-Radius Controllers:** Focusing on containment protocols to ensure that when an agent inevitably fails, the impact is limited.

## 6. How can a business distinguish a real AI strategy from "fluff"?

The document provides a "litmus test" to expose whether a strategy is based on operational reality or "executive bullshit". By asking five specific questions regarding:

* Top failure modes and detection methods.

* Naming the specific individual accountable for the agent.

* Viewing the decision-tiering framework.

* Auditing the agent’s chain of reasoning.

* Demonstrating a functional kill switch in production.
